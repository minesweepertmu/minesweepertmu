# 💣 Minesweeper Online

This is a web-based version of the classic Minesweeper game, with some extra features and improvements. Here are some of the highlights:

- 🎨 Better original interface: The game has a sleek and modern design, with enhanced colors and several themes. You can also adjust the grid size and the number of mines to suit your preference.
- 🏆 Global high scores: You can compete with other players around the world and see how you rank on the leaderboard. The high scores are stored in Firebase, a cloud-based database service.
- 💻 Application made with pure JS, HTML and CSS: The game logic, interface and animations, all made using pure JS, HTML and CSS, so the website loads and runs very fast💨.
- 🤖 I am planning on adding a bot that will automatically solve the game, using some clever algorithms and heuristics. This will be a fun and educational feature to see how a computer can play Minesweeper.

🙃 I hope you enjoy playing Minesweeper Online and feel free to give me any feedback or suggestions.
